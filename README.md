# OTEL test app

This is a small Next.js app used for testing and demoing the Checkly OpenTelemetry integration.
It randomly throws errors, so we can get some traces quickly. Have a look at the `app/page.tsx` file to see how it does this.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
